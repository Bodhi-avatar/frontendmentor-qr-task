## Overview

The first coding challenge I have ever done after 8 years of graduating in IT. There had been numerous attempts at learning HTML & CSS completely, specially with the new HTML5 - I believed alot had changed (and it has) along with CSS3. I kept wanting to find a good resource which would let me explore simple -> intermediate -> difficult challenges with enough guidance. At the end, I also kept wanting to get some sort of Free digital Certification for HTML & CSS. But neither did I ever complete any course to the end nor did I get any certification. This will be different. 
Sorry about this background and a personal issue i am working on. I am writing this here for my own purpose for whenever I look back at this again.

P.S.: Since the files provided had both the Desktop and Mobile version, I assumed adding media queries for which I am not completely familiar with yet, which kinda got me scared abit.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am proud that I was able to actually complete the challenge. 
I am also proud of having learnt alot in such a short time about HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

Although there was alot of help from Copilot, ChatGPT and Google this time, I would like to be able to take a glance at any challenge in the future and instantly come up with some techniques to be able to complete the challenge designs within 10 minutes.
